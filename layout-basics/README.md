## Let's work with the box model (and web fonts)!

Included in this repo are the following files:

- index.html
- css/
  - style.css
- mockups
  - section-mockup.png

Some styles are already provided. If there is a note not to remove or modify the CSS ... **do not remove or modify the property/value!**

## Here's what you need to do.

1. Check your HTML. Is it valid? Run the `.html` file through the [w3c validator](http://validator.w3.org/). If there are no errors, go ahead and begin styling! **Other than any necessary correction, you may not modify the HTML!**

2. Set the headers and body text using [Google Web Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts). Headers are set in Arvo (Bold 700). Body text is set in Open Sans (Normal).

2. Place the content within a container. Center the container, which should not stretch beyond 960 pixels. Make it flexible. :)

3. Use box-model properties (margin, border and padding) to style the navigation bar. **Be creative!**

  From a design standpoint, make sure 'Home' remains aligned with the header above and content below, and there is adequate whitespace between each link. Consider adding borders, hover effects, colors, backgrounds, etc. The colors you choose should match or blend well with the choices for the rest of the site.

  Spend some time on this task. Try different options. 

4. Use box-model properties to style the sections as specified in the mockup. Since **you may not modify the HTML**, you will have to use a couple of the more advance selectors to style section content.


## How to tackle the project

Agree with your pair on a task you want to accomplish. Work on easy, familiar things first.

As you complete a task, check it off. Discuss the next task, write it down and move on.


## Why isn't X working?

I'm around to help and answer questions, but try working through the problem with your pair first.

Some things to ask yourselves if something does not work as you expect:

- Are your file names correct?
- Did you forget to include quotes around attributes?
- Are there typos in element, attribute, value names?
- Did you forget to close a tag?
- Is your style sheet linked to properly?
- Are you missing any 'punctuation' in your CSS file (i.e. colons, semicolons, curly braces)?
- Are your selectors correct?
- Are your property names correct?
- Does the property accept the value you are giving it?

You may refer to your notes, book or any resources made available to you in the [GitHub class repo](https://github.com/umiami-web-design).

You may even want to get used to looking up information on the [MDN: CSS Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference).

**Good luck!**
