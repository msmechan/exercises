## Let's style a web site!

Included in this repo are the following files:

**HTML**
- barack-obama.html
- index.html
- mitt-romney.html

**Images**
- img/electoral-map-2012.png
- img/barack-obama.jpg
- img/mitt-romney.jpg
- img/romney-obama-meet.jpg

**Mockups (for reference)**
- mockups/index.png
- mockups/obama.png
- mockups/romney.png


##Here's what you need to do.

**1. Check and fix your HTML.**

Is your HTML working? Is it valid? Are there broken images or links? There are mistakes in the .html files which will make styling your pages difficult. Run each .html file through the [w3c validator](http://validator.w3.org/).

If there are no errors, broken links or images, go ahead and start styling!

**2. Create a stylesheet.**

Create a directory (`css`). Create a stylesheet named `style.css`. Link to `style.css` in each HTML file. Make sure the style sheet is linked correctly (and works) before getting too deep into styling.

**3. Review the mockups and style!**

The mockups indicate how your pages should look. Re-create an identical version. Be aware of all the details and specifications.

Not *everything* has to be exact. If your font size or line height is a little different, that is okay. But you do not have the freedom to style these pages as you want.

You may need to write a CSS block, then overwrite it with rules which are a little more specific.

You may need to add `span` tags, as well as `id` and `class` attributes. What you use for the values is up to you, but remember to make values descriptive so you know what they mean if you only looked at the `.css` file.

**Other than adding `span`, `id` or `class` to the HTML document, you are not permitted to modify the html files otherwise.**

**NOTE:** (Since this cannot be displayed in the mockup, in addition to changing the link color, you must also create a hover effect which changes the link from blue to red. If you are not sure about a color, use the Digital Color Meter.)

## FAQ

**What font family, size should I use?**

The mockups use a sans-serif font. If you want to use a specific font such as Helvetica, Arial, Avenir, etc., the choice is yours. The base font size should be 16 pixels.

**What colors should I use?**

You have an image (the electoral map figure) which has a shade of red and blue. Use the Digital Color Meter to sample the color values and use those when red or blue is needed. By using colors which are already present in your content, you ensure consistency in your design.


## Tips

- None of the CSS rules I created for this solution combine more than three selectors (and that's rare). In most cases it is two or fewer.

- In using classes, I only needed to create two. Sometimes I combined these classes with multiple elements.

- Creating a table border and changing the style of the bullets in lists using CSS involve properties we did not go over in class. If you breeze through all the other tasks, feel free to explore tackling these challenges. You may need to look up properties in the [MDN: CSS Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference) or seek tutorials which explain how to do this.


## How to tackle the project

Agree with your pair on a task you want to accomplish. Work on easy, familiar things first.

As you complete a task, check it off. Discuss the next task, write it down and move on.


## Why isn't X working?

I'm around to help and answer questions, but try working through the problem with your pair first.

Some things to ask yourselves if something does not work as you expect:

- Are your file names correct?
- Did you forget to include quotes around attributes?
- Are there typos in element, attribute, value names?
- Did you forget to close a tag?
- Is your style sheet linked to properly?
- Are you missing any 'punctuation' in your CSS file (i.e. colons, semicolons, curly braces)?
- Are your selectors correct?
- Are your property names correct?
- Does the property accept the value you are giving it?

You may refer to your notes, book or any resources made available to you in the [GitHub class repo](https://github.com/umiami-web-design).

You may even want to get used to looking up information on the [MDN: CSS Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference).

**Good luck!**
