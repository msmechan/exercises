## Let's build a web site!

The objective of this task is to get familiar with HTML by building a small, three-page web site.

**You are not expected to complete the site in one session!** The purpose is to *learn* how to process information, try many HTML tags and get familiar with the workflow of building pages.


## Instructions

Clone the `exercises` repository by clicking the 'Download ZIP' button.

You will be working in the `html` directory.

Included in this repo are the following files:

**Text**
- election.txt
- obama.txt
- romney.txt

**Images**
- electoral-map-2012.png
- barack-obama.jpg
- mitt-romney.jpg


##Here's what you need to do.

**1. Organize the content into separate .html files.**

Set up your HTML files. Each document should be its own web page. Make sure your main page is saved as `index.html`. You should also have `barack-obama.html` and `mitt-romney.html` files with the appropriate content included.

**DO NOT change file names, or move them into a different directory.**


**2. Mark up the content**

There are many types of content included in the documents. Text, lists, photos, figures, abbreviations, tabular data, etc. Use semantic tags to organize the information. There's also a hierarchy to the information presented.

Think about how would you mark up the information included. Is it text?  Is it a header?  A list?  Ordered or unordered?  A figure?  Would the information work in a table?  Should the text be emphasized?

You may choose to mark up the text in each document (and simply re-name the files), or create brand new files and copy/paste the text in bit-by-bit. Be sure to discuss (and agree!) with your pair on what kind of workflow you would like to establish.

There may be tags you can use (which we may not have gone over in lecture) which are better suited for presenting the information at hand. Feel free to refer to the your notes, book or the Mozilla [HTML Element Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element).

This step should take a long time. There is a lot of content to code.


**3. Link the pages**

Once you have marked up each page, link the pages together.

At the top of each document, create the site's navigation ("Home", "Barack Obama", "Mitt Romney"). Make it so a person could start at any page and get to any other page.

Maybe you want to link other bits of content on each page to pages within your site?


## How to tackle the project

Agree with your pair on a task to accomplish. It is okay to work on easy, familiar things first.

Write down the task. When you complete it, check it off. Then decide on a new task to tackle.

If you get stuck, it is okay to set the task aside and start a new task. Note the item you struggled with (so you can spend time on it later) and keep moving forward.


## Why isn't X working?

I'm around to help and answer questions, but try working through the problem with your pair first.

When something does not appear to work as you expect, ask yourself:

- Did you forget to close a tag?
- Are there typos in element, attribute, value names?
- Did you forget to include quotes around attributes?
- Are your file names correct?

Remember, you can always refer to your notes, book or any resources made available to you for this course.

**Good luck!**
