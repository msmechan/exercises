    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>The <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> presidential election of 2012 was the 57th quadrennial presidential election. It was held on Tuesday, November 6, 2012. The Democratic nominee, incumbent President <a href="barack-obama.html">Barack Obama</a>, and his running mate, Vice President Joe Biden, were re-elected to a second term, defeating the Republican nominee, former Governor of Massachusetts <a href="mitt-romney.html">Mitt Romney</a>, and his running mate, Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.</p>

    <p>Obama would go on to win a decisive victory over Romney, winning both the popular vote and the electoral college, with 332 electoral votes to Romney's 206. He became the eleventh President and third Democrat to win a majority of the popular vote more than once.</p>
