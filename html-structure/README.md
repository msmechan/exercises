## Let's structure a web site!

The objective of this task is to organize content using HTML5 structural tags. (And there may be one or two debugging tasks in this exercise!)

**It is okay if you do not complete this exercise in one session!** The purpose is to *learn* how to process information, try HTML structural tags and (maybe?) fix bad code.

## Instructions

Clone the `examples` repository by clicking the 'Download ZIP' button.

You will be working in the `html-structure` directory.

Included in this repo are the following files:

**Text**
- barack-obama.html
- index.html
- mitt-romney.html

**Images**
- barack-obama.jpg
- electoral-map-2012.png
- mitt-romney.jpg
- romney-obama-meet.jpg

**Styles**
- style.css

**DO NOT change file names, or move them into a different directory.**


## Here's what you need to do.

**1. Identify structure.**

Look at each web page and determine the structure of the content. Note some content has changed slightly from the `html` exercise.

Identify a `header`, `nav`, `main` and `footer`. You may want to print out a copy and draw boxes around content you believe should be grouped. You may also sketch out the site structure in a notebook. Then identify each `section`, `article` or `aside`.

Apply the HTML tags as necessary in each file.


**2. Validate the HTML.**

After you have added structural tags, run each document through the [W3C HTML Validator](http://validator.w3.org). Does everything check out? Are there mistakes which may have been overlooked? Did your professor introduce a bug? :}


**3. Verify by linking to the included CSS file.**

Inside the `head` of each document (below the `title`), include the following line of code:

`<link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" />`

This is a style sheet. Defined are styles which should distinguish one part of the page structure from another. **Do not modify this code!**

If you did the exercise correctly, the CSS will highlight the different elements of the structure.



## How to tackle the project

Agree with your pair on a task to accomplish. It is okay to work on easy, familiar things first.

Write down the task. When you complete it, check it off. Then decide on a new task to tackle.

If you get stuck, it is okay to set the task aside and start a new task. Note the item you struggled with (so you can spend time on it later) and keep moving forward.


## Why isn't X working?

I'm around to help and answer questions, but try working through the problem with your pair first.

When something does not appear to work as you expect, ask yourself:

- Did you forget to close a tag?
- Are there typos in element, attribute, value names?
- Did you forget to include quotes around attributes?
- Are your file names correct?

Remember, you can always refer to your notes, book or any resources made available to you for this course.

**Good luck!**
