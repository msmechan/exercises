# Site Architecture

The purpose of this exercise is to have you organize and link to correct file paths.

Included in this file are the following directories and files:

- cats/
  - index.html
- flynn.html
- flynn.jpg
- index.html
- piper.html
- piper.jpg
- quorra.html
- quorra.jpg
- style.css
- subtle-grunge.png
- zedo.html
- zedo.jpg

(Please disregard site-architecure.png and README.md; these are in the repo for instructions only.)

**NOTE: You may not re-name files or move them into a different directory structure other than what is displayed below. Keep all files within the `site-architecture` directory.**

This project is considered finished when no links (including the style sheet) or images are broken.


## Task 1

Organize the files on your computer as follows.

- cats/
  - index.html
  - black-n-white/
    - charlie.html
  - tabby/
    - flynn.html
    - piper.html
    - quorra.html
  - tux/
    - zedo.html
- css/
  - style.css
- img/
  - flynn.jpg
  - piper.jpg
  - quorra.jpg
  - subtle_grunge.png
  - zedo.jpg
- index.html


## Task 2

Open each HTML file. Find the tags which have properties such as `href` (for links and the css file) or `src` (for images) and link them using **relative paths**. You do not have to understand the code in the CSS file, but you have to make the styling appears on the web page by adding the path to it in `link`.


## Task 3

If you finish, can you figure out how to fix `style.css` so it includes `subtle-grunge.png` as a background? In `style.css`, look on line 4 for: `background: url("");` What is the path to `subtle-grunge.png`?


## How to tackle the project

Organize your files. If you do not organize the files, you can not move on to Step 2. Work with each file one-by-one. Do not assume all files will have the same paths. Yes, patterns may develop, but make sure you are linking to the right images, files.


## Why isn't X working?

Things to ask:  Are your file names correct?  Are you trying to 'go forward' into a path which does not exist?  Are you remembering to go back a directory?  Are there typos?

Remember, you may always refer to your notes or resources made available to you in the GitHub class repo.

**Good luck!**
